Description: Computes Bayes factors for testing (in)equality constrained hypotheses
             on standard deviations (or variances) for independent outcomes / between-subjects designs.
             Accommodates K = 1 and K = 2 sample tests with intervall null hypotheses. For K > 2 sample tests,
             allows testing mixed hypothesis of the form '1>2=3>5,6>7'.
